### About the Experiment  

This experiment is aimed at determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices, which are fundamental concepts in linear algebra with wide applications in scientific computing, physics, and engineering. The study involves numerical techniques such as the Power Method and other iterative approaches for approximating dominant eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors. Students learn how eigenvalue problems are essential in solving systems of differential equations, analyzing stability, performing principal component analysis (PCA), and modeling physical systems. The experiment also emphasizes the computational aspects of eigenvalue determination, convergence properties of methods, and error considerations.
